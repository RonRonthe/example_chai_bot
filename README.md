# example_chai_bot
Code to build and deploy a GPT-J Chatbot on [Chai](chai.ml). All the code was written with python3. 

This includes a wrapper for the [getneuro.ai](getneuro.ai) GPT-J API, they charge for this but you can email me at dev@chai.ml and I will give you my access credentials so that you can build your own bot and it can be deployed to Chai.

Requirements: you will need to ```pip install chaipy``` and ```pip install npu``` (you need at least python 3.7 for chaipy to work). chaipy makes it possible for the bot to be deployed to Chai, and npu is the GetNeuro package (the API we use for GPT-J).
